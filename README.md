Usage
-----
```kotlin
val algorithm = Algorithm(
    KeyProperties.KEY_ALGORITHM_AES,
    KeyProperties.PURPOSE_ENCRYPT or KeyProperties.PURPOSE_DECRYPT,
    KeyProperties.BLOCK_MODE_GCM,
    KeyProperties.ENCRYPTION_PADDING_NONE
)
val algorithmSpec = AlgorithmSpec(algorithm, "Alias")
```
```
or algorithmSpec with default value
```
```kotlin
val algorithmSpec = AlgorithmSpec()

val vault = Vault.getInstance(algorithmSpec)

val text = "test"
val encrypted = vault.encrypt(text)
val decrypted = vault.decrypt(encrypted!!)
```
